<p>Alura is a company that offers several technology courses.<br>Eventually they propose challenges in some specific areas. 
The students have to develop a full project from the beginning. In this case, it was a Front-End Challenge. 
The goal is to develop a website to a fictional e-commerce of geek products.</p>

<p>The site shows a list of products separated by categories and the user can log in and add or remove items.</p>

<p>The first part is about constructing the html structure of home, list of products, login, product addition and produtc pages. 
Then set up the CSS configuration following a Figma with instructions but students were free to use creativity and change anything.</p>

<p>On the second part the pages should became dynamic using JavaScript. A REST API was simulated using json-server in a way to create a  data base with the 
list of products and its specific informations, that shloud be dynamically exhibited on the webpage.</p>

<p>To develop this project some specific courses from Alura were indicated as knowledge resource. Actually, the visual part is finished, 
  including responsive design. The dynamization is still in process.</p>
