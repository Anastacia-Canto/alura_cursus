## Lib-Markdown

This was a project to develop a library that validates links on a webpage that were writen using Markdown syntax.

On this project was possible to learn topics as:

> How to start a project on NodeJS
> 
> How to use npm libs
> 
> What is the package.json and node_modules
>
> How to manipulate the modules using ESM (EcmaScript Modules) and CJS (Common JS)
> 
>  How to read files with fs.readFile()
>  
>  How to work with asynchronous functions using .then() and async/await
>  
>  Regular expressions
>  
>  Unit testing


To test this program you must have the text in a text file. So the lib will look for the links and test them. You should manipulate the lib using a terminal.


 - Commands:
```
To just have the links found in the text:

npm run cli
```

```
To validate the links:
npm run cli validar
```

Some tests were implemented to check if the lib is working.  
```
To run the tests:
npm run test
```
