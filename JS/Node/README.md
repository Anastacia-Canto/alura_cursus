## Lib-Makrdown

This was a project to develop a library that validate links on a webpage that were writen using Markdown syntax.

You must have the text in a text file. So the lib will look for the links and test them. You should manipulate the lib using a terminal.


 - Commands:
```
To just have the links found in the text:

npm run cli
```

```
To validate the links:
npm run cli validar
```

Some tests were implemented to check if the lib is working.  
```
To run the tests:
npm run test
```
